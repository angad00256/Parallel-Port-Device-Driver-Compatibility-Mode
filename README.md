# Parallel-Port-Device-Driver-Compatibility-Mode
A parallel port is an interface for connecting peripherals. The project aims at writing a device driver routine for 74LS244 parallel port and establish parallel communication in Compatibility mode in which data is transferred in parallel form using 8 data pins. The transfer occurs byte by byte between two devices.
